### Assignment 3 – Inheritance, Polymorphism and Interfaces

Inheritance (Chapter 11, starting page 286)

Create the following classes:

Vessel, which is an abstract class and represents any water-going craft. 
Ship, which is a Vessel. Fun Fact: A Ship is any vessel that is large enough to carry smaller Boats.
Boat, which is a Vessel.
and Cat, which is just a cat.

All Vessels should have a float speed; and string name;
Ships should have an int fuel and an int maxFuel. 
Boats should have an int oars; 
Cats should have an int hunger and an int maxHunger;

All Vessels should have the ability to Move. 
If a Ship has fuel, it moves at the rate stored in the float speed;
A Boat moves by its speed multiplied by how many oars it has.
